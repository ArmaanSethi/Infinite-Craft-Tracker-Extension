Infinite Craft Tracker Extension

For the game Infinite Craft: [https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft) 

Currently tracks what you have created in infinite craft and records which two elements you merged to create new elements.

Currently just logs the graph/object to the console. I would like to write the object to the popup.html when the extension icon is clicked, but I cannot figure that out.

Would also like to export as a csv to write to a spreadsheet.

## Installation

To experiment with these samples, please clone this repo and use 'Load Unpacked Extension'.
