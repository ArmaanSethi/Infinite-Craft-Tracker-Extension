Infinite Craft Tracker Extension

For the game Infinite Craft: [https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft) 

I have never used javascript or made a chrome extension so it's a WIP.

Currently tracks what you have created in infinite craft and records which two elements you merged to create new elements.

When you click on the extension icon it should populate with a CSV of all of the two elements you merged to create new elements.

Currently also logs the graph/object to the console because clicking on the extension icon is unreliable. 

Would also like to export as a csv to write to a spreadsheet.

Currently the "Copy to Clipboard" button is bugged and it does not copy the expected values.

## Installation

To experiment with these samples, please clone this repo and use 'Load Unpacked Extension'.

## Contributing

If anybody knows javascript better than me and wants to contribute/improve this feel free.
